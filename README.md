## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html) for messaging

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the Flex Microservice project locally.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/flex-microservice.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd flex-microservice
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables.

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   RABBITMQ_URL=your_rabbitmq_url
   AUTH_SECRET=your_auth_secret
   ```

### Running Locally

1. **Run the database**

   Start your SQL Server or PostgreSQL instance locally or in a Docker container.

   ```bash
   docker run -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 postgres
   ```

2. **Run RabbitMQ**

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
   ```

3. **Run the microservices**

   Each microservice can be started individually. Navigate to the corresponding folder and run:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

4. **Access the application**

   The application can be accessed through API endpoints exposed by each microservice. Example:

   ```
   http://localhost:5001/api/trades
   ```

## Usage

Here are some examples of how you can use the Flex Microservice:

- **Submit a Trade**: Make a POST request to the trades API to submit a new trade.
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:5001/api/trades" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"symbol": "AAPL", "quantity": 100, "price": 150.25}'
  ```
- **Get Portfolio Data**: Access an investor's portfolio via the portfolio API.
  ```bash
  curl -X GET "http://localhost:5002/api/portfolios/12345"
  ```

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests, execute:

```bash
dotnet test
```

## Deployment

To deploy the Flex Microservice to a production environment:

1. **Build the Docker images**

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Run the Docker containers**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. **Scaling Services**

   Use Docker Compose or Kubernetes to scale individual microservices as needed.
